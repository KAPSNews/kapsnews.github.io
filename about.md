<h3>How did KAPS News start?</h3>
<p>Founded in 2019, KAPS News is a collaborated effect between CAPS Uintah Basin and V6 Media. We are a student-run organization at Union High School in Roosevelt, Utah. We provide live coverage of school sports and announcements.</p>

<h3>What does KAPS stand for?</h3>
<p>While KAPS does not have a meaning, CAPS stands for Center for Advanced Professional Studies.</p>

<h3>But why change the C to a K? Kenter doesn't make sense!</h3>
<p>We changed the first letter in our prefix to keep our station in accordance to <a href="https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/602-land-of-the-k-home-of-the-w-americas-radio-nations">United States call signs</p>.

<h3>Okay, so what is CAPS then?</h3>
<p>According to CAPS Network's official <a href="https://yourcapsnetwork.org/">website</a>, CAPS is a type of high school program:
<blockquote cite="https://yourcapsnetwork.org/">
Center for Advanced Professional Studies (CAPS) programs are nationally recognized, innovative high school programs. Students fast forward into their future and are fully immersed in a professional culture, solving real world problems, using industry standard tools and are mentored by actual employers, all while receiving high school and college credit. CAPS is an example of how business, community and public education can partner to produce personalized learning experiences that educate the workforce of tomorrow, especially in high skill, high demand jobs.
